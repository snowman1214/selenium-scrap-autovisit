I want a software that I can queue up a list of keywords to search on google.  It will go on google, search for Roofing Contractor Los Angeles and many other keywords.  It will go to the organic search result #1 position, click on each website, then hit back.  Then it will click on the organic search result #2 position, back, then organic search result #3 position.  It will do it all the way to the #10 position, back, then go to the next keyword.  I can have hundreds to thousands of keywords.

This software need to be set it and forget it.

do you know how to do with headless?  chrome driver?
i'm thinking about it, i feel that might work better
seem like a real browser visiting.
Have a text file of all keywords, I can add/remove keywords while it is running [1 keyword per line] [In this text file, I should be able to do “Roofing Contractor Los Angeles, 1500”, the 1500 = max search for that keyword, if you have better idea on how to do this, let me know.]  
Have a text file where I can add/ignore websites to ignore. E.g. hireageek.com, I can add/remove sites while it is running (It will never click on website that is listed here. [1 domain per line]
I can set the amount of time to spend on site before clicking back.  It should be in sec or millisec.  I might have to go ½ a sec as my standard.
Auto save campaign, if I close out of it, all settings will be saved.  Open again, I can continue where I left off.
If Google captcha is found, have it reload search and try again
Max search = max search for the month, we need a way to count how many was done, maybe like this Roofing Contractor Los Angeles, 1500, 556.  556 = how many was done, 1500 =  how many total.
Need GUI to specify Keywords, Domain to Ignore, Time on Site, Start/Stop Button, Pause Button
Software need to be portable, it’ll look for the text files in local folder, so I can move project to different PCs if needed.
Support proxy x.x.x.x:XXXXXX   ip/port
I plan on letting this run 24/7
